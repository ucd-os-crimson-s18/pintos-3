process successfully loaded its executable. You must use appropriate synchronization

/*
Waits for a child process pid and retrieves the child’s exit status.
If pid is still alive, waits until it terminates. Then, returns the status that pid passed
to exit. If pid did not call exit(), but was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due
to an exception), wait(pid) must return -1. It is perfectly legal for a parent process
to wait for child processes that have already terminated by the time the parent calls
wait, but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its child’s exit status, or
learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.
wait must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following conditions is true:
• pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process. pid is a direct child
of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid as a return
value from a successful call to exec.
Note that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child
process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to wait(C) by
process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new
parent if their parent process exits before they do.
• The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a process
may wait for any given child at most once.
Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and may
even exit without having waited for some or all of their children. Your design should
consider all the ways in which waits can occur. All of a process’s resources, including
its struct thread, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and
regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.
The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in
‘userprog/process.c’) from main() (in ‘threads/init.c’). We suggest that you
implement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function
and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().
Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest.

never return either of these file descriptors, which are valid as system call arguments
only as explicitly described below.
Each process has an independent set of file descriptors. File descriptors are not
inherited by child processes.

possible up to end-of-file and return the actual number written, or 0 if no bytes could
be written at all.
Fd 1 writes to the console. Your code to write to the console should write all of buffer
in one call to putbuf(), at least as long as size is not bigger than a few hundred
bytes. (It is reasonable to break up larger buffers.) Otherwise, lines of text output

indicating end of file. A later write extends the file, filling any unwritten gap with
zeros. (However, in Pintos files have a fixed length until project 4 is complete, so
writes past end of file will return an error.) These semantics are implemented in the
file system and do not require any special effort in system call implementation.
